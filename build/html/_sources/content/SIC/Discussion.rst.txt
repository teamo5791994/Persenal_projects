Conclusion
============================

1. Proposed CNN model can tackle with incidence angle, banding effect and rough wind to a large extent without further preprocessing of SAR images.
#. First successful attempt that uses SAR images and MWR SIC product as input data, and the performance of prediction in low ice concentration area is reasonable.
#. Predicted SIC with high resolution for detecting water ice borders and small ice floes.

Limitation
------------------

1. Smooth ice with low backscatter are misidentified as open water
2. Underestimation of ice area with strong backscatter.
